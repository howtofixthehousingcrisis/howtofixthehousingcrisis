<h2>Capital Gains and Tax Concessions</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Remove Capital Gains Tax Concessions for all property.</li>

  <li>Remove depreciation deductions for all residential property.</li>

  <li>Give the Australian Taxation Office the authority and
resources to police and data-match property sales and ownership on a
large scale.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Stamp Duty</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Replace Stamp Duty with a broad-based Land Tax.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Option to pay up-front or upon sale for low income
earners / disabled / welfare recipients to avoid additional burden.</li>

    <li>Land tax should increase (like income tax) based off
total land assets value owned relative to the national average to
ensure land is utilised efficiently; i.e. you should pay heavily to
have a single dwelling on a large block in the centre of the city, and
to incentivise many small owners rather than a few centralised landlord
individuals/companies.</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Negative Gearing</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Remove Negative Gearing from all property, except on new
property for the first five years of ownership.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Where it is allowed, limit Negative Gearing to offset
same
asset class income; i.e. losses on property can only offset income from
other property.&nbsp;</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Ownership</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Restrict individuals and couples to a single investment
property or holiday home in addition to their primary residence.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Except if additional property is housing someone for whom
the
owner is registered as the primary carer (e.g. the property houses a
disabled person or someone with age-related illnesses).</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Sales</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Owner occupiers have the right to first refusal&nbsp;on
all established residential property.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Unless an investor submits plans and acts on a
significant
rebuild or renovation that results in a net increase in the number
premises, square footage, bathrooms and bedrooms within 12 months of
purchase.</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Public Housing</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Government to return to public housing initiatives by
building public housing en mass.</li>

  <li>Government to have right of first refusal on property
within 1 km of a major public transport hub, such as a train station.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Dwelling Quality Standards and Faults</h2>

<ul>

  <li>All new dwellings must meet new energy efficiency and build
quality (lighting, airflow, insulation, noise isolation, etc.)
standards.</li>

  <li>Minimum size for apartments, bedrooms, living areas,
kitchens etc.</li>

  <li>New development sale money held in escrow by the government
and
paid out to the original developer following a half-life of 1 year
(maximum 5 years) - to be used as insurance against any major repairs
where a property developer intends to strategically declare bankruptcy.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Anti-Money Laundering</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Subject Real estate agents to the provisions of the
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF
Act)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Foreign Ownership</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Only Australian Citizens or Permanent residents may
purchase Australian property.</li>

  <li>Match purchase prices against declared income and prosecute
any discrepancy.</li>

  <li>Match ownership records against Immigration records of time
in
country. If the resident is absent more than 6 months in three
consecutive years a forced sale occurs.</li>

  <li>Force the sale of properties bought using overseas funds
by proxy of an Australian citizen or permanent resident. Prosecute the
individuals involved.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Immigration</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Return net overseas migration to the 1970-2000 average of
~75,000
per year (currently 200,000) or to the OECD average per capita.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Occupancy</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Properties unoccupied for more than 9 months, based on
electricity, water and gas usage data matching, will incur a fine equal
to 10% of the marketable value of the property.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Loans</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Limit loans to a maximum Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) of 80%</li>

  <li>Ban interest-only loans.</li>

  <li>Restrict loans to a maximum 15 year repayment period.</li>

  <li>Impose a Mortgage Servicing Ratio cap (the amount of
gross monthly income spent on mortgage repayments) of 30% of the
borrowers gross monthly income.</li>

  <li>Impose a maximum debt to income ratio of seven times gross
annual income.</li>

  <li>Loan deposits must be paid in cash, not in equity such as
equity in existing property.</li>

  <li>Deposit/Repayment assistance from parents is treated as
taxable earned income to the property purchaser(s).</li>
